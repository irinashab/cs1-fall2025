    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
This course provides an introduction to Computer Science and programming, focusing on programming as the foundation for understanding and exploring the world of computers. Students will learn essential programming concepts and develop coding skills through hands-on practice.
The course is designed to be flexible and adaptive to the needs of students, whether they are majoring in Mathematics/Computer Science or coming from other disciplines. We will begin with simple programming assignments, gradually building toward more complex tasks. By the end of the semester, students will work on individualized projects that showcase their acquired skills and align with their personal interests or academic focus.
Our primary programming language will be <strong>Processing</strong>, a Java-based language with its own Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Processing is widely recognized for its versatility and accessibility, making it an excellent choice for beginners and those interested in creative coding applications.

    
    </p>
    <h3>Course Goals</h3>
    <p>This course has two goals: to teach students to "talk to the computers in the computer's own language" and to prepare Math/CS majors for Computer Science 2 and upper-level electives.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Upon completion of this course, successful students should be able to</p>
   <ul>
  <li>Use basic computer terminology</li>
  <li>	Understand Processing syntax including
    <ul>
      <li>variables and data types</li>
      <li>conditionals</li>
      <li>loops</li>
      <li>arrays</li>
      <li>strings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn how to handle images and program simple animations</li>
  <li>Make the programs interactive</li>
  <li>Understand the ideas of Object-Oriented programming including</li>
       <ul>
           <li>classses</li>
           <li>methods</li>
           <li>basics of inheritance</li>
       </ul>
  <li>Do basic debugging</li>
 
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Book and Course Materials</h3>
    <p>Daniel Shiffman<br/>
Learning Processing:<strong> A Beginner's Guide to Programming Images, Animation, and Interaction</strong> (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Graphics), Second Edition, website:<a href="http://learningprocessing.com/" target="_blank">http://learningprocessing.com/</a>.
You can check out an e-copy of this book from the library. Details are on Brightspace.
We will also use online Processing references at <a href="https://processing.org/reference/" target="_blank">https://processing.org/reference/</a>.
</p>
    <h3>Required Software</h3>
    <p>To develop and run programs, you will need Processing installed on your computer. To download the latest version of it, go to <a href="https://processing.org/download/" target="_blank">https://processing.org/download/</a>.

     </p>
    <h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Life happens. If you miss class, check Brightspace for notes and turn in any due work. Stay caught up by coming to office hours or working with classmates. Missing a class<strong> does not grant you an automatic extension </strong> on assignments submission.<br/>

</p>
    <h3>Collaboration Policy/Academic Integrity</h3>
 <p>Discussing homework is encouraged - copying is not. All submitted work must be your own. Plagiarizing another student’s work can lead to academic sanctions per the <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity" target="_blank"> Purchase College’s Academic Integrity Policy </a>
 We take cheating seriously!<br/>
    </p>
    <h3>Policy on ChatGPT and Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3>
    <p>The use of ChatGPT and other large language models is not allowed for writing or coding assignments in this course, unless you receive explicit permission from me in advance.
This class is about learning the material by engaging with it directly - struggling, questioning, and building understanding step by step. Letting an AI generate your work short-circuits that learning process. Moreover, these tools often produce incorrect or misleading content.
Permitted Uses: Exploratory Investigation. You may use LLMs like ChatGPT to explore broader questions, investigate ideas, or find sources—just not to generate or write your actual assignments. For example, questions like “What is the difference between compiling and running a program?”or “What are some visual ways to understand loops or conditionals?” are curiosity-driven and meant to spark learning and discovery, not solve assigned problems for you.
If you're unsure whether something is allowed, just ask me—I'm happy to help clarify.<br/>
</p>
    <h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
    <p>It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035, 
        <a href="mailto:odr@purchase.edu">odr@purchase.edu</a>.</p>

    <h3>Mental Health and Well-Being</h3>
    <p> Your well-being matters. Check out the <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/counseling-and-behavioral-health-services/" target=_blank>Counseling and Behavioral Health</a> website for resources, including emergency contacts and remote counseling.

.</br>
    
</p>
    <h3>Tutoring Support</h3>
    <p>Tutoring is available in Einstein Corner located in the Natural Science Building, room 3046. Students can schedule appointments through the Starfish platform. <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/">More information here</a> </p>
    <h3>  Course Load and Grade Allocation </h3>
    <p>
    The final grade will be determined according to the following components:
    <ul>
  <li>Programming exercises/homework assignments - 20%</li>
 <li>Midterm project/presentation - 20% </li>
 <li>Midterm exam - 20%  </li>
        <li>Final project/presentation/report - 25% </li>
        <li> Non-programming assignments/quizzes/class participation 15% </li>   
    </ul>
    A midterm examination, a midterm project, and a final project are required.<br/>
    Showing me your neat and complete lecture notes before the end of the semester will add 5 points to your final score. <br/>
     
</p>
<h3>Midterm and Final Projects:</h3>
<p><strong>Midterm Project</strong><br/>
Students may either build on previous work or develop something entirely new. The project must demonstrate the use of variables, functions, and arrays. Incorporating media—such as images, fonts, sound, and/or video—is encouraged.</br>
<strong>Final Project</strong><br/>
Students again have two options:
<ol>
<li>Extend the Midterm Project<br/>
The proposal must include a detailed analysis of the planned changes, explaining both what modifications will be made and why they are significant.</li>
<li>Start a New Project<br/>
Students may design a project of their choice, applying the skills and tools developed throughout the semester. Possible project types include tools, games, visualizations, animations, interactive artworks, or other software projects.
</li>
</ol>
<strong>Presentation and Report</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li>Both projects must be presented in class.</li>
<li>The final project must be accompanied by a written report. Please consult Brightspace for the final project report guidelines</li>
</ul>
<br/>
</p>

<h3>Exams/Quizzes</h3>
<p>The midterm exam will be closed book, open notes, paper and pencil. Expect pop quizzes on current material</br></p>
<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>Homework will be assigned on each topic. Instructions will be posted on Brightspace; it’s your responsibility to check Brightspace regularly. You will have 2 types of homework, programming and non-programming. <strong>The rule of thumb is if you start a programming assignment in class and do not finish it, it automatically becomes homework</strong>.<br/></p>

    <h3>A Note About Changes </h3>
<p>This syllabus is a guide, not a contract. I may revise the schedule or grading breakdown if needed. The latest version will always be on Brightspace, and I’ll keep you posted.<br/></p>
    <h3>Cell Phone Policy During the Class</h3>
    <p>Keep phones silenced and out of sight during class. Emergencies are the only exception—social media and memes can wait. If your phone rings, you owe us a performance! 📵<br/>
<strong>If I see you using your phone during class, I may ask you to leave.</strong>
